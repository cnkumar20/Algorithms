#########  WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF CODE-DEXTER ##################

Here you can find the implementation of various algorithms implemented in differen languages (most in Java and Python)from
basic toddler level to the Dexter level. And also to understand the Object oriented design concepts so the programs can be scaled.

I am learning a lot by this and giving back to the community by making this public. If you find this useful I will be more happy to know.

Also if you have any comments or suggestions about the code shoot me a mail:
